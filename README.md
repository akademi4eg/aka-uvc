Useless Virtual Circuits

If everything ok, this will evolve to emulator of a simple computer.

Implemented elements:
* basic logic gates (NOT and AND)
* other logic gates based on basic ones
* clocking device, multiplexer and flip-flops
* register and vectorized versions of logic operations

to be continued...
